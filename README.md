## Wikipedia_Test_Package

This package is based on Selenium Framework. It automates testing on Wikipedia's website (https://www.wikipedia.org/). However, only the landing page is being tested in the current version.

To run the test, go to the tests directory and execute the Testfile.py file. In order to use pytest and get a proper testing report, execute test_Landing.py using py.test command in the terminal.

Remember to edit all file /folder paths used in this package.

Thank you.
